## Desktop App for Capturing Images from a Web Cam
##### 2020 ML.NET Hackathon Submission

[Video showcase](https://youtu.be/k5tZmwdKqAQ)

Tool to capture pictures from a web cam to use in creating image classification models with
ML.NET. I want to build a minimal viable product for developing the training models for image classification 
and object detection. ML.NET and other tools provide ways to create the training data and models for these
algorithmns.  
I started this project with one goal, but failed short due to my expertise, time, and knowledge. However, I 
entered it and pivoting this project for gathering training data for vision-based deep learning algorithmns.    

### Technologies
Project is created with:
* ML.NET
* WPF
* EMGU.CV

### Closing Statements on the Hackathon 
Despite not being statisfied with my final project, the overall experience was good. If I were
to participate in another hackathon such as this, I would make it a little easier on my be limiting the
scope of the project or joining another team. There were some amazing projects submitted through. Thoses 
include the winners which involved smart labeling with IoT, anomaly detection in networks, 
and sentiement analysis with twitter.  
I am going to continue to develop this app hope to improve on it or merge it with another project. I 
believe there is value in this feature. I believe it is included with other video editing software like VLC.
